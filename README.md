## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting used car prices based on various vehicle attributes such as model, year, fuel type, mileage, and more. It includes:
- A **Random Forest** model for regression.
 mse, r2 (15.133098857888191, 0.8770261551947751)
- A **Tkinter-based GUI** that allows users to input car details and predict the price.

## Features
- **Model Training**: The `notebooks/usedCarPrice.ipynb` notebook demonstrates the entire pipeline from data cleaning, feature engineering, to model training using Random Forest.
- **GUI Application**: The `gui/car_price_gui.py` file creates an interactive user interface for predicting car prices based on user inputs.
